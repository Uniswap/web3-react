# Configure your connector(s):

Next, we want to configure our connector(s) with our supported chains.
It is recommended to put your connector configurations in separate files.


**MetaMask**
```tsx
//connectors/metaMask.ts

import { initializeConnector } from "@web3-react/core"
import { MetaMask } from "@web3-react/metamask"
import { ALLOWED_CHAINS } from "../chains.ts"

export const [metaMask, hooks] = initializeConnector<MetaMask>(
  (actions) => new MetaMask(actions),
  ALLOWED_CHAINS
)
```

**WalletConnect**
```tsx
//connectors/walletconnect.ts

import { initializeConnector } from "@web3-react/core"
import { WalletConnect } from "@web3-react/walletconnect"

import { URLS } from "../chains"

export const [walletConnect, hooks] = initializeConnector<WalletConnect>(
  (actions) =>
    new WalletConnect(actions, {
      rpc: URLS,
    }),
  ALLOWED_CHAINS
)
```

**Network**
```tsx
//connectors/network.ts

import { initializeConnector } from "@web3-react/core"
import { Network } from "@web3-react/network"

import { URLS } from "../chains"

export const [network, hooks] = initializeConnector<Network>(
  (actions) => new Network(actions, URLS),
 ALLOWED_CHAINS
)
```


**Coinbase**
```tsx
//connectors/coinbase.ts

import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@web3-react/coinbase-wallet"
import { initializeConnector } from "@web3-react/core"

import { URLS } from "../chains"

export const [coinbaseWallet, hooks] = initializeConnector<CoinbaseWallet>(
  (actions) =>
    new CoinbaseWallet(actions, {
      url: URLS[1][0],
      appName: "web3-react",
    }),
  ALLOWED_CHAINS
)
```


**Index**
```tsx
//connectors/index.ts

import { Web3ReactHooks } from "@web3-react/core"
import { Connector } from "@web3-react/types"

import { coinbaseWallet, hooks as coinbaseWalletHooks } from "@connectors/coinbaseWallet"
import { hooks as metaMaskHooks, metaMask } from "@connectors/metaMask"
import { hooks as networkHooks, network } from "@connectors/network"
import { hooks as walletConnectHooks, walletConnect } from "@connectors/walletConnect"

const connectors: [Connector, Web3ReactHooks][] = [
  [metaMask, metaMaskHooks],
  [walletConnect, walletConnectHooks],
  [coinbaseWallet, coinbaseWalletHooks],
  [network, networkHooks],
]

export default connectors
```
